# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to predict stock closing prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for time series forecasting.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical stock price data, including:
- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume

## Download
You can download these by cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JanithaRajapaksha/Intellihack_HyperTuners_4.git
```

## Requirements
Make sure to install the following libraries:
```bash
pip install seaborn pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage
Run the Notebooks

## Future Improvements
- Use additional features (e.g., volume, moving averages) for prediction.
- Fine-tune the modelâ€™s hyperparameters.
- Increase the number of epochs for better accuracy.
